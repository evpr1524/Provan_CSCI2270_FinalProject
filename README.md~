# Provan_CSCI2270_FinalProject
This is Evan Provan's Final project.

This project will create an all inclusive zombie apocalypse program which will track available cities which you can travel to (also allowing the addition or deletion of cities), available resources in your inventory, and create safety indexes for each city in the map that describe how safe a city is for you to travel to. It will automatically deduct resources as you travel from city to city, and warn you of how high the zombie density is along a certain path or in a certain city, and keep track of your supplies.
