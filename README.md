# Provan_CSCI2270_FinalProject
This is Evan Provan's Final project.

This project will create an all inclusive zombie apocalypse program which will track available cities which you can travel to (also allowing the addition or deletion of cities), available resources in your inventory, and keep track of your current party. It will include functionality to calculate the shortest path to get from city to city, and the path in which you would have to travel through the least number of citites.
